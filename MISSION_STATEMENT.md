# Athens EuRuKo 2013 Mission Statement
  
### What is Euruko?
  EuRuKo is an annual European conference about the Ruby ecosystem,
  each year organised in a different European city, aiming at bringing
  together individuals, organisations, companies and the community at large. 
  Participants from all over the world gather for 2 exciting days full
  of cutting edge technology presentations, best Ruby practices,
  intriguing techniques and networking. EuRuKo is all about promoting
  Ruby technology and strengthening  the community ties in an individual
  as well as in a collective level.
  
### What is Ruby?
  Ruby, an exciting, powerful, highly productive and mature
  programming language used by thousands of programmers and companies,
  is celebrating its birthday in 2013 and what better way to do it
  than releasing a brand new version alongside a new version of Rails,
  its showcase tool. From its humble beginnings in Japan and stepping
  into the limelight in the later part of the '10s, Ruby manages to
  successfully run diverse operations and enterprises spanning from
  very high traffic social networks to research and government entities. 

### Why are we organising this event? Whatâ€™s the benefit to the local community, greek professional sector and greek education system?
   The greek ruby community is thrilled to host the 11th EuRuKo in Athens on June 2013 and
   while this comes with some unique challenges it also present us with a number
   of  excellent opportunities such as initiating a vital knowledge
   exchange and communication among professionals from around the
   world and their greek peers, fostering the local community and
   introducing the Ruby way to the Greek academic institutions
   and wider private sector. Last but not least, to promote our
   invaluable tool of choice and have fun.
   
May the Rubee with you!
