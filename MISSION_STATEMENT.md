# Athens EuRuKo 2013 Mission Statement
  
### What is Euruko?
  EuRuKo is an annual European conference about the Ruby ecosystem,
  each year organised in a different European city, aiming at bringing
  together individuals, organisations, companies and the community at large. 
  Participants from all over the world gather for 2 exciting days full
  of cutting edge technology presentations, best Ruby practices,
  intriguing techniques and networking. EuRuKo is all about promoting
  Ruby technology and strengthening  the community ties in an individual
  as well as in a collective level.
  
### What is Ruby?
  Ruby, an exciting, powerful, highly productive and mature
  programming language used by thousands of programmers and companies,
  is celebrating its birthday in 2013 and what better way to do it
  than releasing a brand new version alongside a new version of Rails,
  its showcase tool. From its humble beginnings in Japan and stepping
  into the limelight in the later part of the '10s, Ruby manages to
  successfully run diverse operations and enterprises spanning from
  very high traffic social networks to research and government entities. 

### Why are we (the committee) organising this event?
   We are thrilled to host the 2013 EuRuKo in Athens and while this
   comes with some unique challenges it also present us with an excellent
   opportunity to initiate a vital knowledge exchange among
   professionals from around the world and their greek peers. 

### What’s the benefit to the local community, country, greek professional sector and greek education system?
   Στην ενδυνάμωση της επικοινωνίας μεταξύ της τοπικής και της
   παγκόσμιας κοινότητας προγραμματιστών.
   Στην προβολή της τοπικής τεχνολογικής κοινότητας στο εξωτερικο.
   Στην ανάπτυξη της τοπικής κοινότητας προγραμματιστών και την
   προβολή της Ruby σε εκπαιδευτικούς φορείς της χώρας.

### What’s in it for the sponsors, foreign and local?
   Στην ενδυνάμωση των σχέσεων μεταξύ των εταιριών του κλάδου και των
   μελλών της κοινότητας
